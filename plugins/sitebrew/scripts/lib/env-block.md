## Where this runs (read first)

Do not assume you can run commands on the user's computer. Check first:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/setup.mjs" detect
```

The JSON says `mode`.

- `agent`: you have a tool that runs commands on the user's own computer. Follow this skill as written.
- `chatbot`: you cannot run commands for the user (a chat window, a cloud sandbox). Run nothing and do not say you ran anything. Follow the "Chatbot mode" section of this skill: ask the same questions, and give the user the command to paste into their own terminal and what they should see when it works.
- `remote` is `true`: this is a cloud session, not the user's computer. Install nothing here; say so and use the chatbot steps.
- `unsure` is `true`: ask once, in the user's language, "Can this window run commands on your own computer?" Then add `--as agent` or `--as chatbot` to the command. The user can always choose `chatbot`.

If this command cannot run at all (no command tool, or `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is not filled in), you are in chatbot mode. In Codex use the folder two levels above this `SKILL.md` file instead of `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`.
